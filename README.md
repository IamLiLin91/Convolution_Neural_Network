## Background
**Context**

Got this dataset while searching for handwritten signature datasets for signature verification

**Content**

Contains Genuine and Forged signatures of 30 people. Each person has 5 Genuine signatures which they made themselves and 5 Forged signatures someone else made. The naming of images is explained here. NFI-00602023 is an image of signature of person number 023 done by person 006. This is a forged signature. NFI-02103021 is an image of signature of person number 021 done by person 021. This is a genuine signature.

## Tasks
1. Import the signature dataset from the CNN_Practicum folder, consists of different subfolders with real and forge signatures and perform data preprocessing.
2. Develop a convolution neural network (CNN) model to classify signatures whether they are real or forged.
3. Use classification metrics to show model performance and discuss them in your report.
